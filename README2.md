**1. Model Architecture:**
   - **Generator (G):**
     - Identity Encoder: Residual convolutional layers encoding a random reference frame.
     - Speech Encoder: 2D-convolutions encoding input speech segment.
     - Face Decoder: Convolutional layers for upsampling and reconstruction.
   - **Expert Lip-Sync Discriminator:**
     - Adaptation of SyncNet, a pre-trained discriminator for accurate lip-sync detection.

**2. Training Strategy:**
   - Generator trained to minimize L1 reconstruction loss and lip-sync loss from expert discriminator.
   - Visual quality discriminator introduced to improve overall visual quality.
   - Joint optimization for superior sync accuracy and visual quality.

**3. Evaluation Metrics:**
   - **LSE-D (Lip Sync Error - Distance):**
     - Average error measure in lip-sync accuracy, calculated as the distance between lip and audio representations.
   - **LSE-C (Lip Sync Error - Confidence):**
     - Average confidence score, indicating the audio-video correlation.
   - **FID (Fr√©chet Inception Distance):**
     - Used to measure the quality of generated faces.
    
** Overview about data preprocessing

1. **Video Processing:**
   - First we process each video file in the LRS2 dataset.
   - then read video frames, detects faces in batches using the initialized face alignment instances, and saves the aligned face images in the preprocessed dataset directory.
   - The face images are saved as individual JPEG files.

2. **Audio Processing:**
   - For each video, we extract the audio using the `ffmpeg` command and saves it as a WAV file in the corresponding preprocess
    dataset directory.

3. **Parallel Processing:**
   - The video processing is parallelized across multiple GPUs using a ThreadPoolExecutor. Each GPU handles a portion of the video files.

4. **Frame and Window Processing:**
   The frame and window processing module consists of several functions for preparing input data for training a neural network. The   
   `get_frame_id` function extracts the frame ID from a given frame path, and `get_window` constructs a window of consecutive frames for 
   a specified duration from a starting frame. The `read_window` function processes the frames in a window, resizing them to a specified 
   image size. `crop_audio_window` extracts a segment from the audio spectrogram corresponding to a given start frame, and          
   `get_segmented_mels` segments the audio spectrogram into multiple mel spectrogram segments for the window frames. The 
   `prepare_window` function normalizes pixel values and adjusts the data format, preparing the window frames for input by the neural 
    network.
5. **Dataset Length and Item Retrieval:**
   In each iteration, the dataset class randomly selects a video and a frame within that video. It then retrieves the window frames and 
   corresponding wrong window frames from the selected frame, ensuring a sufficient number of frames are available. The class loads the 
   audio spectrogram of the video and performs necessary preprocessing steps, including cropping and segmenting the spectrogram. The 
   final input tensor `x` is constructed by concatenating the prepared window frames with the wrong window frames, facilitating the 
   integration of visual information. Simultaneously, the output tensor `y` is created using the original window frames, enabling the 
   model to learn the relationship between visual and audio features. The processed tensors are returned for training the neural 
   network, contributing to the effective synthesis of visual and audio cues during the training process.

6. **Data Format and Tensor Types:**
   - The input tensor `x` is a 4D array with dimensions `[batch_size, channels, height, width]`. It contains the window frames and wrong window frames.
   - The output tensor `y` is a 3D array with dimensions `[batch_size, channels, height, width]`. It contains the original window frames.
   - `mel` and `indiv_mels` are tensors related to audio processing, representing mel spectrograms.

7. **Data Augmentation:**
   - The code includes data augmentation by zeroing out the bottom half of the window frames.
